# tabletop-combat-helper
A local network helper application for players of table top roleplaying games to visualize combat elements such as player positions, health, etc..

## Current State:

Currently, the application simply shows a preset list of units on a preset map.
Networking only works in terms of unit propagation, but not unit sprite.

## Pending:

- Networking to properly propagate sprites.
- Networking to work with public / private IPs.
- Player system to allow different players to log and command their unit.
- Map selection.
- Better unit selection.
